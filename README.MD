## 5. Order Lifecycle Flow Diagram

```plaintext
1. Customer reserves a table.
2. Customer views the menu and places an order.
3. Order is sent to the kitchen and updated in real-time.
4. Kitchen prepares the order and updates the status.
5. Customer tracks the order status.
6. Once the order is ready, customer makes a payment.
7. Payment is processed and an invoice is generated.
8. Customer receives the invoice and completes the transaction.
9. Customer submits feedback and earns loyalty points.
